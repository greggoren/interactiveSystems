			Thanks a lot for participating in this experiment.
			<br> In this experiment we simulate a search engine environment. The experiment includes the following stages:
			<ol>
			<li>Choose a query of interest</li>
			<li> After submitting the query you will be presented with 5 documents - the documents are ordered according to their relevance scores assigned by the search engine's algorithm (from most to least relevant)</li>
			<li>Re-enter the query. You will be presented with a list of modified documents ordered via the same logic in previous step. This stage, simulates a re-ranking procedure done by the search engine. In real systems, documents are constantly changing. Hence, once in a fixed period, all documents are re-indexed by the search engine and are re-ranked with respect to different queries</li>
			<li> Fill a summarizing form</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			The algorithm which is the basis of the search engine considers the following three factors:
			<ol>
			<li> Quality features - signals that portray the quality of the document in terms of readability and vocabulary</li>
			<li> Language modelling features - signals that portray how query terms are distributed within the content of the document </li>
			<li>Term frequency features -  signals that portray how frequent are the query terms within the content of the document</li>
			</ol>
			<b>Please go over the overview/instructions for each page very carefully! </b>
